# 🍪 Oreo - Jetpack Compose Demo App

Oreo is a minimalist Android demo app built with **Jetpack Compose**, following modern **MVVM architecture**, **SOLID principles**, and **best practices**. The goal is to simulate a pull-to-refresh UI that fetches a random number from a fake network source, demonstrating proper layering, clean state management, and error handling.
